  <p class="mt-3 text-slate-300 leading-7">I'm Marimi Lamont, a full‑stack developer, dad and husband based in Greensboro, NC. I enjoy shipping polished user experiences, improving system reliability, and collaborating across product, design, and engineering to deliver business impact software and experiences. I'm comfortable owning features end‑to‑end, debugging issues within existing codebases, and mentoring teammates through code reviews and pair programming.</p>
